This project contains 3 scripts that analyze genetic variation and markers within a subset of genes. These scripts were originally developed for transcriptome parsing and filtering at a specific threshold within a subgroup of genes, such as a gene family or genes grouped by Gene Ontology, however these scripts can be easily altered for application to larger data sets. Arguments that pertain to input/output files and important parameters were included in each script.
